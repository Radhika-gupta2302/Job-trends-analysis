# Job-trends-analysis
This project focuses on analyzing remote job trends using data from RemoteOK, a popular remote job board. The goal is to identify key insights such as in-demand job roles, frequently required skills, salary distributions, and top hiring companies. The data is collected through web scraping, then cleaned and processed using Python libraries like BeautifulSoup, pandas, and NumPy. Exploratory data analysis and visualizations are performed using tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to uncover patterns in job postings over time. Findings from this analysis can help job seekers understand the remote job market and guide employers in understanding talent trends. The project is organized into scripts for scraping, Jupyter notebooks for analysis, and a directory structure that separates raw data, visualizations, and outputs.
